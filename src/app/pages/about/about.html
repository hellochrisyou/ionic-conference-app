      <!-- The Ionic Conference is a one-day conference on {{ conferenceDate | date: 'mediumDate' }} featuring talks from the Ionic team. It is focused on Ionic applications being built with Ionic Framework. This includes migrating apps to the latest version of the framework, Angular concepts, Webpack, Sass, and many other technologies used in Ionic 2. Tickets are completely sold out, and we’re expecting more than 1000 developers – making this the largest Ionic conference ever! -->
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This App is designed for messaging between friends and others.<br><br>

      project
      in discovering how to use Ionic with Angular 2+. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with Firebase for
      authentication,
      this app
      provides the ability to message, view message history, and a history of locations from where your messages were
